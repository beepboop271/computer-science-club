# Lessons, Exercises, and eventually Solutions for my group at RHHS Computer Science Club 2020-2021

The title explains it all.

I strongly encourage a reader to take the content here as a guideline/order for topics to learn, and search up phrases/topics to read other articles or more in depth.

There are no citations for the text because most of it is written from memory - nothing is very interesting though, you could verify things with a single search.

All images included directly in the lesson are my own, unless otherwise specified.

All code is not copied, though simple examples may be similar to code on the internet about the same simple ideas such as the echo client/server.

Corrections or other concerns: open an issue.
