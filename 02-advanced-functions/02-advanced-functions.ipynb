Since it uses `*args, **kwargs` at the end, it captures all possible arguments that you could want to give to `fun`, then unpacks `args` and `kwargs` when the actual call to `fun` is made. You could have a function that is declared to take 1 positional argument, and it would work. Or, you could have a function with 10 positional arguments and 5 keyword arguments, and it would work. Just imagine this as a big pipe of arguments: you take in `*args, **kwargs` in the definition and call the function with `*args, **kwargs`. As far as both sides know, they're just passing and receiving arguments as usual, but you're free to inspect the arguments in between.\n",

    "The decoration should use the provided function e.g. `int`, `float`, to convert each argument, which would allow a call such as `fun(\"1\", 5.8, \"5.9\", 1)` to succeed. Optionally add support for `**kwargs`\n",

    "    else:\n",

    "The decoration should maintain a list of values. Each time `fun` is called, the return value is added to the list. There will then be a `return_chance`% chance that `fun` returns with a list of all the stored values, otherwise `None` is returned. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(fun(1, 5))  # None\n",

If the function is called, the args that were used and the return value that was produced is stored in the decorator. When the function is called with arguments that have been seen, the stored return value is returned instead of evaluating the original function."
